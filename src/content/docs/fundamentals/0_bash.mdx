- cli is important
  - uniform interface -> compatable with each other / easy to combine into automations
  - lower barrier for creation -> more available tools
  - faster than GIUs
  - sometimes they are your only option
- amazing post https://gabevenberg.com/posts/cli-renaissance/

{/*When hacking pretty much anything (online), there are some tools that you
end up using a lot. It's definitely worth learning these tools in and out,
because

- knowing the capabilities of these tools gives you ideas when hacking
- learning how they work gives you specific knowledge about the underlying
  technology

The terminal (or shell or command line) is the most powerful way to use most
tools. Most GUIs (graphical user interfaces) have to be dumbed down because
showing the user 200 buttons, text inputs, and sliders would be way too much
information to process and get familiar with.

That's where the command line interface (CLI) comes in.

All CLI tools can do the exact same thing a GUI can, they just use a single line
of text instead of many buttons and text boxes. Most of the time, the text-only
approach ends up letting you do what you want faster and with less mental
overhead.*/}

Luckily, there is a fun and interactive way to learn the most common tools.
Plus, once you learn a few, the rest are super easy to pick up.

and don't come back until you're done. If you get stuck, try one more out of the
box idea, and then head to the hints page (TODO).
