The command line interface (CLI) is an invaluable addition to any developer's
toolbox. They have a uniform interface, allowing for easy usage and creation, as
well as an easy way to combine them, similar to how you combine functions to
make a program.

Due to their low barrier for creation, there are magnitudes more CLIs than
graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for anything you could imagine. Need to check
the spelling on a document? Need to slice a video? Need to buy coffee? Those can
all be done from the CLI.

But why would you use the CLI over a graphical application?

Let's take `git` as an example. Why would anyone use the `git` CLI over Github
Desktop?

1. Github Desktop doesn't expose every option in `git` to you, because there
   would be hundreds of buttons. In the CLI, they are all accessable, and even
   can autocomplete options.
2. Using the `git` CLI is faster than opening the GUI and clicking around. To
   add your new changes to `git`, all you have to run is `git add -p` to review
   them interactivly, and `git commit -m "updated..."` to commit them.
3. Sometimes they are your only option. If you ssh into a computer (more on this
   later), you don't have a screen to show GUI programs.

Luckily, there is a fun and interactive way to learn the most common CLI tools.
Plus, once you learn a few, the rest are super easy to pick up.

box idea, and then head to the hints page (TODO).
