### Neovim

If you are new to neovim, you should install it at https://neovim.io/

The very first thing you should do is to run the command `:Tutor` in Neovim. This will walk you through the basics.

If you don't know what this means, type the following:
  - \<escape key>
  - :
  - Tutor
  - \<enter key>


If want a good starting place for your configuration, I would suggest with https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim

Eventually, I would recommend reading through the whole thing, but the tldr is:

(explain how to do the following)
- autocomplete (Ctrl+Y to accept, Ctrl+N for next, Ctrl+P for pref)
- code formatting (space f)
- next/prev diagnositc (\[d and \]d)
- go to definition / find references (gd,gr)
- rename (space r n)
- file search (space s f, space s a)
- local file text search (/)
- full project text search (space s g)
- open/close terminal (use something like tmux zelij, or built in terminal tabs)
- hover (shift K)
- signature help (\<C-h\>)
