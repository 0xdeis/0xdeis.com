When hacking pretty much anything (online), there are some tools that you end up using a lot.
It's definitely worth learning these tools in and out, because

- knowing the capabilities of these tools gives you ideas when hacking
- learning how they work gives you specific knowledge about the underlying technology

The terminal (or shell or command line) is the most powerful way to use most tools.
Most GUIs (graphical user interfaces) have to be dumbed down because showing the user 200 buttons, text inputs, and sliders would be way too much information to process and get familiar with.

That's where the command line interface (CLI) comes in.

All CLI tools can do the exact same thing a GUI can, they just use a single line of text instead of many buttons and text boxes.
Most of the time, the text-only approach ends up letting you do what you want faster and with less mental overhead.

Luckily, there is a fun and interactive way to learn the most common tools. Plus, once you learn a few, the rest are super easy to pick up.

Head over to [https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) and don't come back until you're done. If you get stuck, try one more out of the box thing, and then head to the hints page (TODO).
