## Computer Networks

One of the reasons computers are as useful as they are today is because of their
ability to communicate with each other.

The internet, the thing that allows computers to talk to each other, is a
complex collection of technologies and concepts. The seemingly simple task of
loading https://google.com in your browser probably took over 10 computers to
complete.

{/* rust mentioned !!! */}

As Jon points out, metal models are very important for understanding complex
topics. By the time you complete these exercises, you should have a strong
mental model of how the internet works. When thinking about how some program
works, you should be able to abstract away the parts that don't matter and focus
on the details that do.
