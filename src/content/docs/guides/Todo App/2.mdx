Select a place where to store your project. If you don't have one in mind,
`~/code/` could be a good start.

```bash
cd ~/code/
mkdir todo-app
```

## Creating a go module

You need to select a unique identifier for your project, called a module path,
so that people can locate and import code from it. If you have a domain, a
common convention is to use a URL that you have control over. I personally use
`github.com/AlexanderHOtt/<project name>`, but if you have a domain you want to
use, it could be `<project name>.example.com`.

```bash
go mod init github.com/<github username>/todo-app
```

You should have a new file named "go.mod" with similar contents below

<FileTree>
- go.mod
</FileTree>

```txt title="go.mod"
module github.com/0xdeis/todo-app

go 1.23.0
```

## Hello World

Create a new file named "main.go".

```go title="main.go" {"1": 1} {"2":3} {"3":5-7}
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello world")
}
```

1. All go files must be a part of a package. The default package is "main".
2. Go import statements have the package name in double quotes.
3. The `main` function is the default entry point of the go program.

```bash
go run .
```

```
Hello world
```

Change the program so that it prints your name.
