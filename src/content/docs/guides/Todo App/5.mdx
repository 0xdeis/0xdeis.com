## Fast Refresh

It's pretty annoying to `ctrl+c` `up arrow` every time you make a change.
If only there was some way to watch for file changes and then do something...

That's where [`air`](https://github.com/air-verse/air) comes into save the day.

Air is "live reload for Go apps". That means whenever a file is changed, it re-runs a command we specify.

To install, run `go install github.com/air-verse/air@latest`

And use this command to start it

```bash
air --build.cmd "go build -o main main.go" --build.bin "./main"
```

The `--build.cmd` tells air how to build your go program, and the `--build.bin` tells air what to run.

Change the port the server is running on.
You should see air stop and restart your server. 
Make sure it works by checking the server is running on the new port you used.

It would be annoying to type that out every time we want to start development, and it would only get worse. 
We could put that in a bash script, but air supports using a configuration file.
Run `air init` to generate the default one named `.air.toml` (you need to pass `-a` to `ls` to see files that start with ".").
It should look like

```toml
root = "."
testdata_dir = "testdata"
tmp_dir = "tmp"

[build]
  args_bin = []
  bin = "./tmp/main"
  cmd = "go build -o ./tmp/main ."
  delay = 1000
  exclude_dir = ["assets", "tmp", "vendor", "testdata"]
  exclude_file = []
  exclude_regex = ["_test.go"]
  exclude_unchanged = false
  follow_symlink = false
  full_bin = ""
  include_dir = []
  include_ext = ["go", "tpl", "tmpl", "html"]
  include_file = []
  kill_delay = "0s"
  log = "build-errors.log"
  poll = false
  poll_interval = 0
  post_cmd = []
  pre_cmd = []
  rerun = false
  rerun_delay = 500
  send_interrupt = false
  stop_on_error = false

[color]
  app = ""
  build = "yellow"
  main = "magenta"
  runner = "green"
  watcher = "cyan"

[log]
  main_only = false
  time = false

[misc]
  clean_on_exit = false

[proxy]
  app_port = 0
  enabled = false
  proxy_port = 0

[screen]
  clear_on_rebuild = false
  keep_scroll = true
```

It's quite a lot, but we won't have to make any changes for now. 
With the configuration file setup, we can just run `air` and it will work.

## Project Structure

As with anything, a little bit of organization can go a long way.
The Go language gives a recommendation for the project structure of a web server.

https://go.dev/doc/modules/layout#server-project

<FileTree>
- project-root-directory/
  - go.mod
  - internal/
    - auth/
      - ...
    - metrics/
      - ...
    - model/
      - ...
  - cmd/
    - api-server/
      - main.go
    - metrics-analyzer/
      - main.go
</FileTree>

We will take a lot of inspiration from this. 
However, let's start with something much simpiler.

<FileTree>
- project-root-directory/
  - .air.toml
  - go.mod
  - cmd/
    - web/
      - main.go
</FileTree>

We also need to update our `.air.toml` to reflect the new project structure.

```toml
[build]
  # ...
  cmd = "go build -o ./tmp/main ./cmd/web/"
```

Let's run `air` one more time to make sure everything works.

Why would someone use fast refresh?
