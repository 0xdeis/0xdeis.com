Custom backend web servers are a very common piece of software, because most web applications need one. 
So, you can create a web server is basically any language.
Most languages have some library/framework that makes writing web servers easy.

<TabItem label="Go">

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
)

func main() {
	router := http.NewServeMux()

	router.HandleFunc("GET /", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		w.Write([]byte("Hello world"))
	})

	fmt.Println("Listening on http://localhost:8080")
	http.ListenAndServe(":8080", router)
}
```

from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return "Hello world"
```

```ts
import Fastify from 'fastify'

fastify.get('/', function (request, reply) {
  reply.send({ hello: 'world' })
})

fastify.listen({ port: 3000 }, function (err, address) {
  if (err) {
    fastify.log.error(err)
    process.exit(1)
  }
})
```

```rust
use axum::{response::Html, routing::get, Router};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let app = Router::new().route("/", get(handler));

    let listener = tokio::net::TcpListener::bind("127.0.0.1:3000")
        .await
        .unwrap();
    println!("listening on {}", listener.local_addr().unwrap());
    axum::serve(listener, app).await.unwrap();
}

async fn handler() -> Html<&'static str> {
    Html("<h1>Hello, World!</h1>")
}
```

As there are many options to go with, selecting the correct one for the job can be difficult.

Selecting your most familiar language is what most beginners go with, but it may not be the best option for your problem.

Most beginners start with high level languages like JavaScript and Python, which have bad error handling and large garbage collection spikes.
If uptime, stability, and maintainability are important to your backend, you should consider other options.

However, if iteration speed and code sharing are more important, then you would make a different choice.

Premature optimization is bad, but sometimes by moving forward without any optimizations, you can't go back and add it later.
JavaScript can only run so fast. You can't make it run faster than go, it's not physically possible.

If I wanted a service that I could write and forget about, and know it would still be running in 5 years, I would pick rust.

If I want a good balance between iteration speed, code maintainability, and good error handling, I would choose go.
Go is a very straight forward language, almost forcing you to be productive. Compared to the other examples above, there is no magic `@` operator like python. There is no ambiguity on how a JavaScript object gets converted into text. And, there is no verbose syntax list Rust, because Go is garbage collected.

All these points make Go an excellent choice for writing web severs.
