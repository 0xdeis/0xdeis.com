title: "Persistence with a Database"
---

Every time we restart the app, all the todos get deleted because they are stored in memory.
What's the point of a todo app if it can't remember things?

That's where a database comes into play.

We will be using sqlite3 for this guide, but you could use postgres or mysql just as easily (apart from the initial setup).



- basic example of get and create with database/sql
  - works, but its pretty verbose and boring to write
  - fix with codegen
  - why not just codegen the whole api?
    - firebase, and why it's bad (security vuln)
- switch to sqlc
  - set up schema.sql
    - sqlite3 db.db < schema.sql
  - set up query.sql
