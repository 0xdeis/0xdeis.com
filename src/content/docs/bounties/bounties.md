title: Programming Bounties
---

Have you ever wanted to contribute to a project but didn't know where to start
or felt it was too overwhelming to dive into something big? Or maybe you've had
ideas but needed a bit of extra motivation to work on them. That's a problem
many students face: getting started and staying engaged.

Bounties are programming projects with a defined scope and (sometimes) have a
legitimate benefit for the club.

Collaboration is a large part of software development, so you are encouraged to
collaborate on these projects (espically the more difficult ones).
