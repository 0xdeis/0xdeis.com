title: Using a Shared Password Manager For Clubs
---

Clubs of all sizes have accounts, emails, physical locks, and sensitive
information they need to store. Keeping those in a Google Doc or private
messages is not secure.

Using a password manager is a more **convenient**, secure, and efficient way to
store, share, and retrieve that information.

- Password managers come with autofill, allowing for longer, encouraging
  non-reused password, all while making it easier to enter credientals than
  manually typing out password.
- Control who has access to what. Share only the social media accounts with the
  social media manager. Share individual accounts _individually_.
- Granting and revoking credentials to people joining and leaving the club is
  easy.

## Choosing a Password Manager

If you want to purchase one, I would suggest either
[1Password](https://1password.com/pricing) or
[Proton Pass](https://proton.me/business/pass)

If you want to self-host one, I suggest BitWarden. They have a
