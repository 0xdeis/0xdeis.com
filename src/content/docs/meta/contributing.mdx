If all you want to do is make a quick edit to a page, there is an "edit page" button at the bottom of every page that brings you to github.
Make your edits, and open a PR.

## Development

This website/documentation page was built with [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/). You write markdown or mdx (markdown extended) and it turns into html.

<Steps>

1. Clone the repo

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:0xdeis/0xdeis.com.git
    ```

2. Install `bun`, a javascript package manager.

    From https://bun.sh/

    ```bash
    # Linux / MacOS
    curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

    # Windows
    powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1 | iex"
    ```

3. Install dependencies

    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

4. Make a new branch

    ```bash
    git switch -c feat/...
    # or
    git switch -c fix/...
    ```

5. Start the dev server

    ```bash
    bun dev
    ```

    ```
    $ astro dev
